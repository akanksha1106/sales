 Task 2: Write Complex SQL Queries for Reporting
Objective
To generate sales reports using complex SQL queries such as daily totals, average transaction value, top-selling products, and city-wise sales summaries.
The goal is to simulate a real-world data reporting scenario where SQL is used to extract meaningful business insights from raw sales data.

💡 What I Built
I created a complete Sales Reporting System using MySQL Workbench that includes:


A relational database schema for customers, products, orders, and order details.


SQL queries to calculate:


Daily Sales Totals


Average Transaction Value


Top 3 Products by Revenue


City-wise Total Sales




A summary report and screenshots of all outputs.



🎯 Why I Built It
This task demonstrates my ability to:


Design a normalized relational database structure.


Write and execute complex SQL queries using JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and aggregate functions.


Perform business-level reporting using real-world data concepts.


Gain hands-on experience with data analytics using SQL.



⚙️ How I Built It
Step 1: Tools Used


MySQL Workbench → for database design and query execution.


SQL language → for data manipulation and report generation.


Step 2: Database Design
Created a schema named SalesReportDB with the following tables:


customers — stores customer details


products — stores product catalog


orders — stores order headers


order_details — stores order line items


Each table is linked using foreign keys, ensuring referential integrity.
Step 3: Data Insertion
Inserted sample data for:


4 customers (from different cities)


5 products (across categories)


5 orders and related order details


This simulated real-world sales transactions.
Step 4: Query Development
Wrote SQL queries using:


JOIN → to combine multiple tables


GROUP BY → to aggregate results by date, city, or product


ORDER BY → to rank data (e.g., top-selling products)


Aggregate functions → SUM(), AVG() for totals and averages


LIMIT → to restrict results for top products


Step 5: Reporting
Generated and verified the following reports:


Daily Sales Totals


Average Transaction Value


Top 3 Products by Revenue


City-wise Total Sales


Captured screenshots of outputs from MySQL Workbench.
